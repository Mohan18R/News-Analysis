- Generates a **word cloud** of frequently used words in headlines

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed before running the script.
```bash
pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud
```

## API Setup
- Obtain a free API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
